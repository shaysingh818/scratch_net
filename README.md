# Scratch Net
This is a neural network built from scratch using the C programming language. This repo contains all the needed utilties for building your own neural networks from scratch. The purpose of this project was to understand the inner workings of backpropagation and how certain activation functions affect the predicted outputs. 

# General Information 

* Network implementation solves the XOR problem
* Uses tanh activation function for each layer
* Calculates loss using mean squared error

## Testing
To run the unit tests, run the following commands
```
make clean
make
./target/test_network
```
